# gladitatorTextGame
Little project made in 1Â½ days, for an exam
The game is based on classes, most of the structure is done

TODO: 
* More elaborate item-system. Ability to pick up items from slain enemies, and replace current equipped ones. 
* More rounds. Currently there's only 1, but more can quickly be added, due to the program being built on classes.
* Display the current characters name in the *DisplayStats* function
